            The best potatoes for mashing depends on your personal preference, as some varieties will give you fluffy results while others will give you creamy results.
        </p>
        <p>
            This recipe calls for baking potatoes (a.k.a. russets), which are ideal for light and fluffy mashed potatoes. A good all-purpose potato, such as Yukon Gold, is also always a crowd-pleaser.

        <p>Ingredient</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic, lower heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture, blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are smooth and creamy.
            </li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
